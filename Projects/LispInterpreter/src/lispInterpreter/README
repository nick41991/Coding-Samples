FILE: LISP Interpreter - README

Included in this TARball is my implementation of a LISP Interpreter.

How to run:
	From source directory (LispInterpreter/src) enter the following:

		dir/LispIntepreter/src$ make
		dir/LispInterpreter/src$ java lispInterpreter.InterpreterMain


Known Issues:
	As it stands the interpreter is very bare bones. It will interpret LISP 
	commands as outlined in FINALPROJECT.pdf successfully. However, it 
	contains no error checking and thus undefined commands will lead to 
	undefined behaviors. Also, sqrt, sin, cos, tan have yet to be 
	implemented.
