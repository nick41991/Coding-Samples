This README is for the cache simulator files run.c, cache.h, and cache.c files.

Compilation:
	To compile simply type "make" to utilize the included make file.
		make clean
		make

	Alternatively, compile with the folowing steps:
		gcc -g -Wall -c cache.c
		gcc -g -Wall run.c -lm cache.o -lm -o run
		
		###Note the use of the math library###

Usage:
	To run type:
		./run [CONFIG] [TRACE] ###Order matters###
	Where:
		[CONFIG] is a .conf file to be used in configuring the cache
		[TRACE] is a .trace file to be used to simulate a program in the cache

Output:
	Output is to standard out unless redirected.
	
	run will print the following five lines:

		Total hit rate
		Load hit rate
		Store hit rate
		Total run time (cycles)
		Average memory access latency
